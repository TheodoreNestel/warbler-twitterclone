Hello Ill be keeping track of what ive done to this app here in this txt file. this will be mostly for me rather than others but I will
include it as part of the repository anyways. I will be commenting in green throughout the app as I learn about how it works.
thank you ! 




Step 1 : Lets learn about how the app works the docs tell me to go take a peep at models.py 
this step for me will be going through the existing code and commenting out all the logic so all working parts 
are explained properly 

- Added autoincrement to all primary keys in models.py (there were indication that that code was removed prior)
- All notes needed added to models.py 
- Added edit bio / background img / location edit and display on users page 
- Added bio to all cards , index.html , following.html , follower,html 
- Added further modification to the edit feature , profile picture , email , username 
- Added functionality for password checking to commit changes
