Hello Ill be keeping track of what ive done to this app here in this txt file. this will be mostly for me rather than others but I will
include it as part of the repository anyways. I will be commenting in green throughout the app as I learn about how it works.
thank you ! 




Step 1 : Lets learn about how the app works the docs tell me to go take a peep at models.py 
this step for me will be going through the existing code and commenting out all the logic so all working parts 
are explained properly 

- Added autoincrement to all primary keys in models.py (there were indication that that code was removed prior)
- All notes needed added to models.py 
- Added edit bio / background img / location edit and display on users page 
- Added bio to all cards , index.html , following.html , follower,html 
- Added further modification to the edit feature , profile picture , email , username 
- Added functionality for password checking to commit changes

Step 2 adding like functionality 

- Added coppied code from home.html which contained the logic for adding like buttons with forms attached 
- Added the copied code to show.html so all messages now have a like button
- Added a Post route in app.py that Currently just prints the message when the like button is clicked 
- Added logic for liking a tweet and storing the like in our db 
- Added Logic to pull all of a user's liked tweet from the database 
- Added New route on profile page that displays all liked tweets in order 
- Added a new function that grabs a single liked tweet based on message Id and the likes inside g.user
- Added Blue and Black thumbs up based on the status of a message if likes by the current logged in user they're blue otherwise theyre grey
- Added tweet unlike functionality 
- Added prevention so User's cannot favourite their own tweets
